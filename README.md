#VM and Hypervisor Detection in C++
This repository contains a C++ program that detects if it is running inside a virtual machine (VM) or on a physical (host) machine. If the program determines it is on a host machine, it further checks for the presence of any hypervisors to detect virtualized environments.

Introduction
Virtualization detection can be useful for software that needs to differentiate between virtualized and physical environments. This code identifies whether it is running on a VM or a physical host and checks for hypervisor presence on the host system. Common use cases include:

Preventing execution in sandboxed environments
Ensuring software runs only on physical machines
Protecting against reverse engineering in VMs
Features
Detects if the program is running in a virtual machine.
Checks for specific VM indicators like BIOS, virtual disk, and MAC address prefixes.
If running on a host machine, checks for hypervisors (VMs) running on the same system.
Detection Techniques
Inside VM Detection
The following techniques are used to detect if the program is running inside a VM:

BIOS Check: Identifies VM-specific BIOS manufacturers (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, Microsoft).
Virtual Disk Check: Searches for specific disk signatures associated with VMs in the registry.
Environment Variable Check: Checks for environment variables set by VMs, such as VBOX and VMWARE.
MAC Address Check: Looks for MAC address prefixes unique to virtualized environments.
VM Processes Check: Checks for processes specific to VM environments, like vmware.exe or vboxservice.exe.
Host Machine Hypervisor Detection
If the code determines itâ€™s running on a host machine, it uses additional techniques to detect hypervisors on the system:

CPUID Instruction: Uses the CPUID assembly instruction to check for hypervisor presence.
Other Techniques: You can expand this detection for other hypervisors if needed.
Installation
To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Compile the code:

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, g++) installed on your system.
Compile the code in a Windows environment to support Windows-specific APIs used in the code.
For example, in Visual Studio, create a new C++ project and add the source files to the project.

Run the program:

Execute the compiled program to see the results in the console.
Usage
Upon running, the program will print whether it is running inside a VM or on a host machine. If it detects a host machine, it will check for the presence of hypervisors and existing VMs on the system.
